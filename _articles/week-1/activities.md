#### Discussion
This week's discussion will be fairly loose, there's a bunch of reading, and a few tasks we'll cover in our call.
I'll share an agenda in advance.

* Introductions!
* Community Participation Guidelines
* Setting up for success
  * Communication channels (private and public)
  * Contributing Workflow (our repo, Debugger repo)
* Goal-setting
* This week's tasks
* What to expect next week
* Q&A


#### This Week's Assignment

1. Introduce yourself, and goals in our Discourse (private) category! I will add each of you, when I have your Discourse ids.
2. Watch Katrina, and Amjinth's story [Me, Myself, Maintainer](../intro).
3. Read Kris, Jess and Steve's stories [Me, Myself, Maintainer](../intro).
4. [Review Debugger's Maintainer Page](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/826490b315548b7b51ba471f43725214af55b0eb/docs/maintainer.md). Don't worry if you have questions, that's normal!
5. Read all about [Inclusivity Bugs](../leadership), including the findings from our Contributor testing on Debugger.
6. Open one inclusivity bug in the Debugger's main repo (I'll explain the format for this, in our first meeting)


NOTE: We'll be working in this repo.  Each participant has their own branch, and will take turns in the maintainer role merging in each other's PRs, prior to submitting them to the main Debugger repo. Please read and understand how branches work](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

  <!-- * Take 10 minutes to complete this [Open Source Career Map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8G3cTYVBrSWcUIaU_m7Xixr3wlDS3rlBL4HvCzoPPw/edit#) -->
