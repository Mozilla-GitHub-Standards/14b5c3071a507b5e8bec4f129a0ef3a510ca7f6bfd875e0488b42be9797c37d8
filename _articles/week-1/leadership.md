### Words Matter

**The [Myth of Meritocracy](https://blog.mozilla.org/inclusion/2018/10/02/words-matter-moving-beyond-meritocracy/), has further contributed to tendencies of underepresented groups to feel like they need to prove themselves to be considered for leadership roles, like project maintainer.**

>“Meritocracy” was widely adopted as a best practice among open source projects in the founding days of the movement: it appeared to speak to collaboration amongst peers and across organizational boundaries. 20 years later,  we understand that this concept was practiced in a world characterized by both hidden bias and outright abuse. The notion of “meritocracy” can often obscure bias and can help perpetuate a dominant culture. Meritocracy does not consider the reality that tech does not operate on a level playing field.  -- Mitchell Baker, Mozilla Co-Founder on removing 'Meritocracy' from their governance page.


**You’ve may have heard the following statistic, but it is worth repeating as being also relevant to open source:**

> Men apply for a job when they meet only 60% of the qualifications, but women apply,  only if they meet 100% of them.  - [Why Women Don’t Apply for Jobs Unless They’re 100% Qualified, Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified)


Whether or not these reflect your experiences, there is more than enough research that shows so-called meritocracies have included effective forms of discrimination. This might be hidden bias, where some aspect of identity causes a person’s contributions to be routinely devalued. It might be over discrimination or harassment. t might be threats that minimize the contributions even offered. Whatever the cause, open source “meritocracies” suffer from these problems – open source projects tend to have less diversity than other software organizations.

### Tackling Toxicity in Open Source Communities

Something important Mozilla, and other open source communities have adopted are strong Code of Conducts to describe the expected [norms for participation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). A good Code of Conduct outlines, not only unacceptable behaviors, but also encouraged behaviors.  Ultimately a CoC is a tool or community health.

While the trend of open source projects adopting a Code of Conduct is increasing, there are still those who protest, and have gone so far as to adopt [alternate agreements](https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC) in protest. While it's important to be aware of those individuals, and groups they are isolating themselves, and their projects.

**As a project leader, one of the most important ways you can use the CoC, is to lead by example, those behaviours you want to see in your community; and to ensure that your process for reporting, and accepting reports in violation of the Code of Conduct are clear to you, and to the community you serve.**


### Technical Leadership

> **Pull Requests are important, but what open source really needs is people to review and triage those PRs.  Ultimately the quality of the project outcomes depend on 3 or more reviews of a single PR.   - Maintainer, Contributing Research Interviews**


As a community leader in a maintainer role, or supporting someone in a maintainer role, the two  important things you can focus on are:

1. **Reviewing Pull Requests** By reviewing, and testing out patches, and commits by contributors you can not only learn the technology, but give meaningful feedback to those contributors, and save engineering time.
2. **Ensuring everyone who turns up to the project is invited to join in**, and has their questions answered.
