title: Inclusivity Bugs
module: 3
summary: "“Inclusivity Bug” term borrowed from Anita Sarma and GenderMag, to describe those unknown barriers and obstacles diverse participants experience using software, that might be otherwise invisible to the majority demographic. The cohort will not work on these bugs, but should be aware of the research driving this project."

We've started using this to describe the **obstacles underrepresented contributors face while attempting to make a first contribution**.  We're starting to get better at creating simple ways projects can evaluate their projects for inclusive design  - like this '[inclusive governance checklist](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/blob/master/evaluation_tools/governance-basic.md)'.

For the Devtools/Debugger project we invested in six, short (1.5 hrs) contribution sessions with volunteer contributors of diverse backgrounds from a gender, and regional perspectives.  What we uncovered can be found in the reading below.

**Our call to action, is to establish a standard for the new [Inclusion Tag](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/labels/inclusion)** and to use the findings in the document listed below to do that for all non-leadership bugs. We'll tackle leadership findings separately.

Don't worry we'll walk through this in our cohort time :)
