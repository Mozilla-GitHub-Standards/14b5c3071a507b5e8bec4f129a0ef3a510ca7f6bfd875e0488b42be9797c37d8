The final week will bring our group together for a last time, to review progress of inclusivity bugs, of leadership, and most of all share our experience stepping into a role, that historically felt inaccessible, and even hostile for underrepresented people.

We'll use our private channel to debrief our experiences, and to support each other in our next steps.
